                <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1 quart canola oil for frying, or as needed</li>
                        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                        <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
                        <li>1 cup Italian seasoned breadcrumbs</li>
                        <li>2 (4.23-oz) packages Boursin Garlic and Fine Herbs Cheese Bites</li>
                    </ul>
                <h2>Steps</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Pour oil to a depth of 2 inches in a large Dutch oven. Heat oil over 
                            medium heat to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            While oil heats, set out 3 wide shallow bowls. Fill them individually 
                            with flour, beaten eggs, and breadcrumbs.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Working with a handful of bites at a time, gently dredge cheese in flour, and shake off excess. 
                            Dip in eggs; let excess drip off. Dredge in breadcrumbs to coat. Place on a small 
                            rimmed baking sheet or large plate. Transfer to freezer for 15 minutes. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Fry boursin bites in batches, cooking until golden, 30 seconds to 1 minute. 
                            Set on paper towel-lined baking sheet. Repeat with remaining bites. 
                            Transfer to a platter and serve immediately.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
